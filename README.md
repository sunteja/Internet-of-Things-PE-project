# Heart Disease prediction of UCI dataset using ML and encrypting this data using pyfhel

## Introduction
With the increasing number of heart diseases day by day, detecting and preventing heart diseases as early as possible has become a necessity for us. Moreover, good data systems can improve the research in heart diseases prevention and can improve and save many people's lives. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, for these purposes, we can use ML to create a model (Naive Bayes classification model) and predict whether a person will suffer from any heart diseases in the future or not based on various parameters in the given data. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem with the normal models is that many patients wouldn't want to expose their data (especially health data) to other people which is why we use encryption so that people who are not allowed to access and use this data can't use the data. <br /> <br />
