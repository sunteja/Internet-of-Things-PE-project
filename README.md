# Heart Disease prediction of UCI dataset using ML and encrypting this data using pyfhel

## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increasing number of heart diseases day by day, detecting and preventing heart diseases as early as possible has become a necessity for us. Moreover, good data systems can improve the research in heart diseases prevention and can improve and save many people's lives. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, for these purposes, we can use ML to create a model (Naive Bayes classification model) and predict whether a person will suffer from any heart diseases in the future or not based on various parameters in the given data. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem with the normal models is that many patients wouldn't want to expose their data (especially health data) to other people (or to the person running the model either) which is why we use encryption so that there are no unauthorized accesses of data. For this an encryption called Homomorphic encryption is used. Homomorphic encryption is an encryption in which all the data is converted into ciphertext or encrypted data and ML models are applied on this ciphertext without decrypting the data. The final results are also given in ciphertext only. So, even the model owners won't have an idea about what kind of data is being processed by their models.<br /> <br />

## Installing Pyfhel

Installing Pyfhel is heavily dependent on the Operating System you use. Based on the operating system you use, follow the instructions given below<br/>
* If you use Linux or Windows then you can just install Pyfhel by opening a terminal (in Linux just open the terminal and in Windows you can use [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) or just install Linux on a [virtual machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/)) and typing `pip install PyFhel`
* If you are using a MacOS then, there is no way of installing Pyfhel as Mac doesn't support it. However, you can install Linux on a virtual machine or a much simpler solution would be to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). In case you are using Google Colab, write `!pip install PyFhel` in the first cell of your notebook and run it to install Pyfhel. You can then import Pyfhel and start using all the APIs in it.
